These are my recent notebooks and projects.

I am an enthusiast about Data Science. I have been doing courses, training, and improve my skills.

I believe the information can be one of the most important assets of people and companies.

Here I am, trying to solve problems, discover new insights, and developing business.

I am an accountant, but not a common accountant :smile:
